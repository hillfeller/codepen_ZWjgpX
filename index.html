      <p>I am a budding programmer with solid Ruby on Rails foundations, interested in both front and backend web development. I'm on the lookout for new technologies, always troubleshooting and always learning.

I previously worked at AvePoint as a senior technical analyst. While troubleshooting their proprietary application and observing its complex relationship with SharePoint, I worked with the development team to interpret the logs. It soon became clear to me that knowing the company's software wasn't enough - I would need to know and understand its underlying code. 

Subsequently, I enrolled in an apprenticeship with Bloc which provided excellent RoR foundations. This included CRUD actions,  model-view-controller architecture, including but not limited to authenticating and authorizing users, signing in, and creating public profiles. Additionally, I decided to focus on RSpecing with TDD.

Currently, I have a working web application entitled Whether the Weather. This application is user community centered, in which users that suffer from joint pain or recent joint surgery lend their ability to sense changes in the weather, to other users of the application. This application also incorporates data aggregation, as it provides the current weather forecast, depending on the userâ€™s location. This application has room for growth, in that it contains game-ifying potential for users who are exceptionally accurate at predicting inclement weather.

I believe that I am well suited to this position, in that I am a fast learner, I have just entered the development world, and I believe this would be an opportune way to start my new career. I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that I would be a good fit for this role, and I thank you for your consideration.
